//! AeternaVault: backups of folders as plain, browsable folders, optionally
//! encrypted.
//!
//! Two programs are built from this library:
//! * `aeternavault` — the window (feature `gui`), see [`gui`];
//! * `aeternavault-cli` — the command line, see [`cli`].
//!
//! Both share the configuration, the backups and the activity history.
